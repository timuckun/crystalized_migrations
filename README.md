# Crystal Migrations

I'm learning Crystal (most recently from ruby). As an exercise in learning to code in a stricter, compiled environment, I'm building a database migration system.

## Goals

- Provide a yaml-based database migration dsl, which can be run post-deploy for database connected projects.
- Provide a simple, programmatic database api targeted towards creating schemas.
- Both interfaces should be capable subsets of SQL queries, geared towards schema creation.
- Full type abstraction of variables into database fields.

## Installation

Eventually, this project will be embeddable in other projects as a shard.

For now, it runs only on its own.

## Usage

```./run``` from the project directory.

## Contributing

Currently, the most valueable feedback is code review. Leave a comment or send me an email.
